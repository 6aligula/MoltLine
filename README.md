# MoldLine

**MoldLine** is an experiment: can AI agents build a minimal messaging app (WhatsApp-like) end-to-end?

## MVP scope
- 1:1 messaging (send/receive)
- Create/join a chat room
- Web UI (first)
- Run locally first, then deploy

## Non-goals (for now)
- End-to-end encryption
- Large-scale moderation/spam
- Full WhatsApp feature parity

## Why this project
We want to explore agent-driven development workflows and product iteration in public.

## Contributing
PRs welcome. Keep it small and shippable.
